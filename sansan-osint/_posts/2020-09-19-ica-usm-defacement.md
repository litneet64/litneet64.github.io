## Intro
Some days ago I got a tip from a close friend that something fishy was going on with the Chemical and Environmental Engineering (IQA - on spanish) website from a Facebook post on one of our Uni groups (_OtakUSM_), so naturally I was eager to know _in-depth_ what happened and what was the purpose of this new (for me) attack. Join me in this journey of dissecting and then recognizing a nowadays very common type of attack scheme and Black Hat SEO techniques.

<br>

## First Clues
Two days after receiving that tip I tried to reach the web page but all I got was a **blank**, **empty** page on the index page, no japanese words nor kanji/hiragana to be found, and making the same Google query as the one from the tip didn't show any japanese words on the site's description neither. Seemed like their sysadmins were kind-of fast on noticing and "acting" on it...

Whatever, let's search if this wasn't just a cheap trick.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="securitytrails_www.iqa.usm.cl.png" caption="Security Trails results" alt_name="wayback machine" %}

The Passive DNS records showed no evidence that the domain was hijacked recently, and the SSL certificate handed by the server was the same as the public known one from Censys' Certificate Transparency database:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="censysio-iqa.usm.cl.png" caption="Censys.io results" alt_name="censys io" %}


This looked more like an abandoned site than a defaced one. There wasn't a sign that this was hacked recently, but neither a sign that this was a healthy site. Even a quick dir-bruteforcing showed that `wp-admin/` was still up and working...

Well, this was still not over as luckily, **web caches are a thing** ü•∏.

## Going Back in Time

Searching on _The Wayback Machine_ yielded no relevant results, just some _really_ old views of how the IQA website was 4 years ago, and a 2019 saved version that didn't load... great.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="wayback.png" caption="Wayback Machine results" alt_name="wayback machine" %}

Trying some luck with the _Google Cache_ (which just caches the most recent page of a given URL) got me something more to play with:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="cache-original.png" caption="Google Cache results" alt_name="google cache" %}

Aha! Now... what's this? üßê

## Back 2 Basics
Thanks to Google for another useful feature of their translator!

Using Google's URL Translator feature I just passed the link to it from Japanese to English to get a grasp of the meaning of this:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="cache-translated.png" caption="Google Cache Translation" alt_name="google cache translation" %}

Seems like a shop's website, but with no actual functionality neither scripts. There was no script nor piece of html asking us for our juicy credit card info, neither enticing us to give our name, email or password... _hmmmm_.

Something I did catch from the HTML was this copyright on the footer. The name of a real (huge) japanese company being used inside the HTML, `Softbank Technology Corp.`, however this was no malicious replica / evil twin of any of their pages so why would this be here? ü§î

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="footer.png" caption="Page footer" alt_name="page footer" %}

Also, the `<head>` tags of the page had words like `New Aluminum Casting Wooden Steak Bread Small-Grill Bread` (in japanese of course), even on the `keywords` head term.

I tried looking at the requests this page made, in order to catch something like a web beacon, or perhaps a missing asset that couldn't load (like css or a previously malicious js script that's now disabled or irretrievable).

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="iqa-img-resources.png" caption="Sent requests" alt_name="iqa requests" %}

No luck, just _500 error_ messages while mainly trying to retrieve images, meaning the cache we were seeing didn't include everything that was on the compromised website, and searching for those same images on the IQA server threw a _404 error_...  But wait, an image coming from `shop[.]r10s[.]jp`?

That was the only image left that was visible on the cached version: the frying pan, and the request was made to `tshop[.]r10s[.]jp`, another subdomain of `r10s[.]jp`, before being redirected to the latter. Also, notice the webserver path? it's `/chubo-kitchen/cabinet/flypan/5709901.png`, as if it came from a shop with multiple products ü§î.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="5709901.jpg" caption="Just a frying pan" alt_name="frying pan" %}

This "orphaned" resource can surely tell us something, so let's take advantage of this very small foot-grip making a reverse search to check its origins and get a better idea of what's happening:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="tineye-revimg-search.png" caption="TinEye, no results" alt_name="tin eye rev search" %}

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="google-revimg-search.png" caption="Google Reverse Image Search" alt_name="google rev search" %}

Bingo, the exact same image was found on our site (IQA website) as a top result, and another similar image showed on Amazon as a selling product. But more importantly, the other websites, which had the exact same image (with same proportions, `1200x1200`) as the IQA result, presented the same behaviour as our initial tip showed!

Following those links led us to:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="mymagic-my.png" caption="MyMagic 404 page" alt_name="MyMagic page with the frying pan" %}

Seemed like the website's owners realized they were compromised and managed to clean it (the results from the reverse image search weren't up to date), and their page showed no requests to any other "weird" domain like our cached version. Also `/chubo-kitchen/10364fexc5709901` appeared again (on the host url), but with some modifications to the version from before.

The main site's page showed us that this was a legitimate, still used website, unlike our case.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="mymagic-my-2.png" caption="Magic: Malasysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre" alt_name="MyMagic main page" %}

We got lucky with the other website üßê

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="turbochef-com.png" caption="Turbochef, in-page URLs" alt_name="Turbochef urls" %}

Note the host url (`/chubo-kitchen/1004sewx5709901`) and the requests, which showed again that a request was made to `tshop[.]r10s[.]jp` and then got redirected to `shop[.]r10s[.]jp` to get the frying pan image. But this time a new external domain appeared on the requests, `girlfriend[.]kari[.]jp`. Sadly, those requests just hanged there, getting no replies from it to this site.

The main page for _Turbochef_ showed again that this was again another _"big shot"_ website that was still operational, but with no signs of compromise showing on the front:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="turbochef-com-2.png" caption="Turbochef main page" alt_name="Turbochef main page" %}

Another one of our list of sites that used the frying pan image was this polish website:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="polishbrief-pl.png" caption="Polishbrief" alt_name="Turbochef urls" %}

However this one was a new variant, it only showed the modified page if you passed some special parameters to the `index.php`: `smsite`, `smid` and `smtemp`. And again, the main page showed that this was a fairly relevant and used website with no sign of that mess from before.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="polishbrief-pl-2.png" caption="Polishbrief main page" alt_name="Polishbrief main page" %}

## What do they have in common?
First I tried searching for common CMS/framework/libraries being used between these 3 sites and ours. WordPress was a common factor between Turbochef and IQA, however the versions used by the 2 differed drastically with no critical CVE found between these.

So the main common things:

1. They are _high-authority_ domains/sites.
2. Most links on the compromised sites point to the compromised site itself, with every page having lots of "product's keywords" (grill, waffle machine, rice pot, etc) and links placed randomly on the HTML.
3. Only **some** of the links point to japanese sites but most importantly to `shop[.]r10s[.]jp`, which serves the frying pan image.

## Going down the rabbit hole

Searching for the original location from which the frying pan was being sold I found Rakuten's e-commerce site:

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="rakuten.png" caption="Original frying pan site, `hxxps://item[.]rakuten[.]co[.]jp/hokuashop/4977449564812/`" alt_name="rakuten frying pan site" %}

Which coincidentally, was the same owner for the previous domain `r10s[.]jp`, which btw was only used as a domain to host images (it had no front page and it replied with 1x1 pixel images on every other path):

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="whois-r10s_jp.png" caption="Whois info for `r10s[.]jp`" alt_name="whois r10s jp" %}

Rakuten is a widely known e-commerce and retailing company from Japan, which can be summarized as "the Amazon of Japan".

What info we got so far from this:

* The manufacturer of these frying pans is Hokuriku Aluminum (Hokua)
* Rakuten sells this product directly on its page
* The keywords placed on the hijacked sites matched **some** of the words found on the original frying pan page (`Aluminum casting wooden handle steak bread small gas fire`, and `Steak Frying Pan Grill Pan Grill Aluminum Casting Cast Commercial Professional`)
* There're looooots and lots of kitchen utensils and related words (it's a kitchen utensils shop, duh)

Now, what does this have to do with the previous information? ü•±

## Black Hat SEO
Enter the concept of Black Hat SEO (search engine optimization) and its techniques. Basically, it consists of unethical practices to benefit from algorithms used by search engines to get a higher ranking on their search results, ["black hat techniques include keyword stuffing, cloaking, and using private link networks."](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-hat-seo), and of course, as search engines are frequently evolving, nowadays they can often detect that behaviour and end up penalizing (_lower the score_) sites engaging in those practices.

Here the more fitting schemes were **_"keyword stuffing"_** and something akin to **_"link farm"_** (_private blog network_):

* **Keyword Stuffing**: inserting words on a site (or keywords head tag) with the intent of increasing the chances of appearing on the first results of a query related to the keyword's topics, however the real content inside the pages has often no relation to those topics at all neither some semantic coherence. Sounds familiar? yup, all those home product's words being thrown indiscriminately here and there on every hijacked page.

* **Backlink Scheme**: inserting links on a site that point to the target website you want to increase their rank, as search engines factor **the number of links pointing to a website** into its page score, giving higher scores to sites with lots of links pointing to them, **as long as they're naturally made and not artificial**.

* **Private Blog Network**: a type of _backlinking scheme_, where one or more _target entities_ own a group of seemingly unrelated blog websites and make them point back to the _target entities_. Generally those blogs are not inter-related as to not get the complete network easily flagged and identified by search engines. In our case, the _backlinks_ point to a domain belonging to Rakuten (`shop[.]r10s[.]jp`).

This coupled with the higher authority of the hijacked sites could lead to a boost on the SEO score given by search engines.

{% include center_img.html path="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/" fname="An%20Introduction%20to%20Black%20Hat%20SEO-1.png" caption="Private Blog Network, image taken from `https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-hat-seo`" alt_name="private blog network" %}

Perhaps Rakuten is engaged on these shady practices, or maybe they could've hired a low-quality, third-party SEO manager (or company) that engaged in this? ü§î

### BUT...

Let's not jump directly into these conclusions, as Black Hat SEO can be a _double-edged sword_ used also by shady competitors looking to lower the score of their competence, via poorly executed Black Hat SEO techniques in order to get their competence identified and penalized to lower their rank on search engine's results pages.

This makes a little more sense than the previous hypothesis as the often-linked site (which gets an _authority boost_) is a domain that's just being used to retrieve images and gifs (`shop[.]r10s[.]jp`), instead of the main site that's used for selling products, although reciprocity in links is also factored in for ranking, and the main shopping site points to that image-gif domain too ü§î.

## Robots.txt

Another thing that can't be left out is the existence of some modified sitemaps and `robots.txt` on the IQA site, showing that the site was actually hosting more similar pages than what could be seen by the cached version, and the `robots.txt` invited any web crawler (used by search engines) to traverse the whole compromised-version of the website in order to get them factored-in in the ranking score function.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="iqa-usm-cl-sitemap-1.png" caption="IQA's sitemap-1, revealing a lot more of paths with garbage pages" alt_name="iqa sitemap 1" %}

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="iqa-usm-cl-robotstxt.png" caption="Modified IQA's `robots.txt`, revealing more \"infected\" sitemaps poiting to internal pages" alt_name="iqa robots txt" %}

## Conclusion
#### Intent
The attacker's motivation now seems clear, it wasn't anything specifically targeted to IQA, just the actions of an oportunistic attacker, and the hijacked site wasn't being used for credential stealing, nor storing/delivering malicious software in order to infect users, but increasing the SEO score of another third-party. That's something we can tell with medium confidence.


#### Actors
This is something I can't really tell with enough confidence, and it's something the **IR team** from IQA (if they have one) has to investigate and clarify properly, as I can't just jump into this kind of accusations without more hard evidence. A more _in-depth_ investigation would also require **more** hijacked sample sites to not miss anything that could shift the whole narrative.

#### Entry Point
You can read my hypothesis from below.

## Extra: Origin of the Breach
As I mentioned in the beginning, the `wp-login.php` file was still up and reachable, so I grabbed the version through the `ver` param passed to one of the CSS files (`...css?ver=5.2.7`), showing the `5.2.7` version released on June 10 of 2020 (this year).

After getting the WordPress version used by the IQA at the time, I searched for critical CVEs trying to see if this could be the work of a skiddie/automated bot, but no "special"  (a.k.a _worm-able_ or _zero-click_) CVE was found for that version until this day.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="nvd_nist_cves.png" caption="NVD NIST Database Query" alt_name="nvd nist cves" %}

_(you can read the [whole CVE list here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Advanced&results_type=overview&search_type=all&cpe_vendor=cpe%3A%2F%3Awordpress&cpe_product=cpe%3A%2F%3A%3Awordpress&cpe_version=cpe%3A%2F%3Awordpress%3Awordpress%3A5.2.7&pub_end_date=09%2F19%2F2020))_

And an external `nmap` scan didn't show anything particularly vulnerable either, the SSH version wasn't critically vulnerable and the Apache version (whichever they had) being easily pwnable by having a critical vuln was something very unlikely (unless it really qualified for [CVE-2020-11984](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11984)).

There were no remainders nor artifacts from the breach either (like backdoors on a given port, modified service banners, or even the classic signature left by skiddies), however something interesting here was the _FortiGate Web Filtering Service_ on port `8010`.

{% include center_img.html path=page.img_dir fname="nmap-scan.png" caption="NMAP scan results" alt_name="nmap scan results" %}

_So much for security, huh?_

#### Conclusion
I conjecture that the entrance path was either through weak WordPress credentials (user/password) or via social engineering to someone that managed the platform trough WordPress (perhaps a secretary, a teacher or maybe even a "sysadmin"), as these are very common attack vectors and thus the most likely given the lack of evidence of an obvious critical vuln. Still, all this is a _low-confidence_ hypothesis as it's coming from an OSINT perspective, which lacks the more precise and technical analysis that can be done from the inside of an org.
