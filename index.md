- Write-ups: _Coming soon..._


# About
Inspired by [_Brian Krebs_](https://krebsonsecurity.com/), [_This Week in OSINT_](https://sector035.nl), [_MalwareTech_](https://www.malwaretech.com/) and many more, I decided to make my own blog about similar topics on **infosec**, but most importantly, about content that's locally related and _barely_ covered by professionals for obvious reasons. Here you will find content about things that I do in my free time.
