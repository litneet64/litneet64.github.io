Inspired by [_Brian Krebs_](https://krebsonsecurity.com/), [_This Week in OSINT_](https://sector035.nl), [_MalwareTech_](https://www.malwaretech.com/) and many more, I decided to make my own blog about similar topics on **infosec**, but most importantly, about content that may be locally related and it's _barely_ covered by professionals for obvious reasons, besides my incursions on some CTFs and sometimes HTB.

Here you will find content about things that I do in my spare time.
